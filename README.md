Hello, my name is Matin and I'm a 19-year-old computer engineering student with a passion for programming. I've been studying programming for some time now, and I have experience with the Python programming language. I've also learned how to use various tools and technologies that are commonly used by developers, such as Linux, Git, Tmux, and Vim.

My GitHub profile showcases some of my personal projects, which I've worked on in my free time. I enjoy using programming to solve problems and create new things, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.

If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to connect, feel free to send me a message!
